Images used in training were not uploaded

Jupyternotebook files used to train the models are uploaded here.

Specifically: 

TrainTestUgatit.ipynb

TrainTest_Model_CAM-VGG16-TV.ipynb

TrainTest_Model_CAM-VGGFace2-TV.ipynb

TrainTest_Model_NoCAM.ipynb

Some of the results used in the project report are in the 'comparisons' folder
They were generated using helpfulscripts.ipynb

CartoonGan generated images were obtained by using the pretrained model from:
https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/CartoonGAN-Test-Pytorch-Torch

The main portion of the model code comes from the U-GAT-IT model

The models I used were editted on top of their code.

The VGGFace2 trained Resnet model were obtained from 
https://github.com/ox-vgg/vgg_face2

The pytorch kid and fid were obtained from 
https://github.com/abdulfatir/gan-metrics-pytorch
